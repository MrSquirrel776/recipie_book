    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagne, an Italian culinary masterpiece, is a dish that embodies layers of flavor and texture. At its heart lies thin sheets of pasta, delicately crafted to provide a sturdy yet yielding foundation. These pasta layers are generously interspersed with a savory blend of ingredients, typically including rich tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel, and a hearty filling of minced meat, such as beef, pork, or lamb. Each layer contributes its distinct essence, creating a symphony of taste that unfolds with every bite. Topped with a golden crust of melted cheese, lasagne emerges from the oven as a tantalizing fusion of tender pasta, robust sauce, and indulgent cheese, enticing the senses with its aroma and promising a gratifying dining experience.
