    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti Bolognese, a beloved Italian classic, is a hearty and flavorsome pasta dish cherished worldwide. At its core, it features al dente spaghetti noodles coated in a rich, savory Bolognese sauce. The sauce, often simmered for hours to develop its depth of flavor, typically consists of finely minced or ground beef cooked with aromatic vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery. This robust base is enhanced with a generous amount of tomato sauce or puree, lending a vibrant red hue and tangy sweetness to the dish. Seasonings such as garlic, bay leaves, oregano, and basil are commonly added, infusing the sauce with an irresistible aroma and taste. The dish is typically crowned with a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese or chopped parsley, adding a final touch of freshness and richness to the ensemble.
